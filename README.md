# TicTacToe-AI
 This is a game of tic-tac-toe with an AI. The AI is made using the Min-Max algorithm. It plays the game perfectly and will always either win or tie a game. Go ahead and try to beat it. I decided to make this after I made a chess bot in my AI class.
 
 There is nothing needed to run this except for python. Just run the main file and you can either play yourself or watch the bots play each other. There are extra instructions in the main file. If you want to just watch the bots play or play a different side, you can make some small changes to the code.
